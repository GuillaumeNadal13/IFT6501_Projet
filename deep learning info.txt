Deep leaning
- uses ?? to recognize certain pattern machine learning algorithms cant (machine learning would need to be programmed
to recognize patterns (shapes) to tell them appart/ like what is a face, what are eyes etc..
- uses neural networks to process data directly
- the source of many different advancements (playing chest, go, other games beating humans, self driving cars,
recognizes spam emails)
- in deep learning you can learn features from just the raw data (feed a bunch of images to the model) then the model
will have an idea of the pattern of the lines (lines and edges*) and shapes of a face for example

- deep learning requires big data
- deep learning requires improved hardware architectures
- deep learning (new softwares) - tensorflow + pytorch

- the BASE of deep learning is Neural Networks
- the basics of the neural network is that it
    1- take the data as input
    2- train itself to understand the pattern in the data
    3- outputs useful predictions

    Input layer -- Hidden layers -- Output layer

forward propagation -- back propagation
1- forward propagation
    Input layer to Output layer
        inputs uses channels to between neurones and each channel have weights

        inputs are multiplied to the weights and the value is given to the hidden layer's neurone
        each neurone is associated with a numerical value called bias which is added to the input sum
        the input sum passes throught the activation function which decides if 1 or 0


    Important terminologie:
        weight : tells how important is that neuron -- higher value = more important

        bias : allows for the shifting of the activation function to the right or left
            is like the neurone having a opinion to the relationship (serves to shift the activation function to the
            right or to the left (0 or 1)

2- back propagation
    Output layer to Hidden layers
        ** is what makes the algorythm learn
        the neural network evaluates is owe performance and checks if its right or wrong
            # if wrong the neural network uses the Loss function to quantify the deviation from the expected output
            # that information is sent back to the hidden layers so that the weights and biais are ajusted
                # so that network accuracy increases
